Description: # Deep Equation Challenge
        
        Package with the submission interface. It has a RandomModel so you can see the expected inputs and outputs. Also, it has a test to validate the students implementation.
        
        The package is pip-installable, it is very easy to update it and implement the predictor for the student best model trained. 
        
        ## Requirements
        
        * python3.7 ou superior
        
        > Outros requisitos que seu modelo precisar deverÃ£o ser adicionados no arquivo `requirements.txt` com a versÃ£o correta!
        
        ## Install
        
        Abra um terminal e, estando no mesmo diretÃ³rio deste arquivo e do `setup.py`, rode:
        
        ```
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        Pronto, vocÃª jÃ¡ tem o pacote instalado. 
        
        ## Test
        
        To test all models:
        ```
        pytest tests/
        ```
        
        To test only the random model (example):
        ```
        pytest tests/ -k test_random -s
        ```
        > `-k` flag allows filtering some tests
        > `-s` shows the print outputs, useful for debugging
        
        To test only the model implemented by the student:
        ```
        pytest tests/ -k test_student -s
        ```
        
        
        ## Note
        
        The `model.py` and `train.py` files are not necessary for the submission, though, the student can use those files (and create other ones, if needed) to run everything inside this package.
